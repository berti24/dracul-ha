# dracul-ha
A theme for Home Assistant based on the popular Dracula theme - https://draculatheme.com/
Inspired by draculaish-ha-theme by malcolmturnbull - https://github.com/malcolmturnbull/draculaish-ha-theme

This theme is work-in-progress.
I used the original Dracula colors and "enhanced" them with some of my own choice.
I also added a light theme based on my own taste.
